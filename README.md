# CodeDot

⚪ CodeDot is a browser-based code editor for creative education.

In simple words, CodeDot allows students to host and edit their web-pages in a shared server, or under the same domain. In more technical words, the app combines a file manager, a multi-user authentication system and a code editor for browser-based editing of content hosted at top-level domain.

✊ CodeDot is built to empower I/M/D students to a coding practice that is autonomous, self-determined, sufficient, and caring.
